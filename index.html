    project management, product development, and trademarks & licensing 
    - working directly with licensees, retailers, and other partners.
    My goals are to create products for users who are passionate about the activities
    they are involved in, making it easier for them to be consistent in their activities
    and in using the product. I enjoy creating programs, activations and experiences 
    to engage consumers. My abilities have turned ideas into successful realities.*</p>
